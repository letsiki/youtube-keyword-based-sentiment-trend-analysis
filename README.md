# YouTube Keyword-Based Sentiment Trend Analysis

This project is an end-to-end data pipeline built with **Apache Airflow**, designed to scrape YouTube video and comment data based on keywords, convert audio to text using Whisper, and analyze sentiment trends using Spark. The pipeline is fully containerized with Docker and designed to be run locally or adapted for cloud deployment.

## üìå Key Features

- **Selenium**: For keyword-based YouTube video scraping.
- **Playwright**: For extracting and deduplicating YouTube comments.
- **yt-dlp**: For downloading audio and video metadata.
- **Whisper**: For transcribing audio to text.
- **text2emotion**: Applied to comments as a UDF inside Spark.
- **sumy**: Applied to transcribed audio for summarization via Spark UDF.
- Every major step is implemented as a **DockerOperator** task within Airflow.

## üß± Pipeline Breakdown

1. **Scraping Group**
    - Verifies PostgreSQL connection
    - Creates necessary tables
    - Scrapes YouTube videos using Selenium
    - Filters videos based on criteria

2. **Chunking**
    - Splits URLs into chunks for parallel processing

3. **Distributed Node**
    - **yt-dlp** for downloading `.mp3` and metadata
    - **Playwright** for comment extraction
    - All executed via DockerOperator tasks

4. **Transcription & Ingestion**
    - Uses **Whisper** to transcribe audio
    - Stores results and metadata in PostgreSQL

5. **Sentiment and Summary Analysis**
    - Spark UDFs:
        - `text2emotion` for comment sentiment
        - `sumy` for summarizing audio transcriptions

6. **Finalization**
    - Cleanup
    - Optional failure path
    - Notification sent via Discord webhook
